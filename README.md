## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to collaborate with other developers on our Collab Lab team to create a “smart” shopping list app that learns a user's buying habits and helps the user remember what they're likely to need to buy on their future trips to the store. 

## How does it work?

As a user, you enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list. You're welcome!
